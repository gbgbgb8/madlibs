## 🤔 WHAT IS THIS GLORIOUS THING?

It's **Mad Libs**. But SILLY. And MULTIPLAYER. And it looks like a **1960s Twister mat** exploded on your phone screen in the best possible way.

Play with your kids! Play with your weird uncle! Play with strangers on the internet who also appreciate the timeless humor of the word "armpit"!

**No app store. No downloads. No accounts. No ads. No backend. No database. No blockchain (thank goodness). Just pure, unfiltered silly word game chaos.**

Just open it. Play it. Laugh until milk comes out your nose (even if you weren't drinking milk).

## ✨ FEATURES THAT'LL KNOCK YOUR STINKY SOCKS OFF

### 🏠 **Create a Room**
Generate a super-secret 6-character room code like `FART42` (okay, maybe not that exact one) and share it with your friends, family, or that one coworker who appreciates quality toilet humor.

### 🚪 **Join a Room**  
Got a code? PUNCH IT IN. You're now connected via the MAGIC OF PEER-TO-PEER WEBRTC. No server required. It's like two tin cans connected by a string, but the string is THE ENTIRE INTERNET.

### 🎮 **Solo Silliness**
No friends? NO PROBLEM! Play by yourself like the beautiful lone wolf you are. The game will judge you (lovingly).

### 📚 **8 Ridiculous Stories**
Including bangers like:
- **"The Magical Fart"** 💨
- **"Dad's Big Adventure"** 🦸
- **"Lawn Darts Disaster"** 🎯
- **"Twister Champion"** 🔵🔴🟢🟡
- **"The Burping Contest"** 🫧
- **"Grandma's Secret Recipe"** 👵
- ...and MORE!

### 🎨 **1960s Aesthetic**
Because nothing says "family fun" like the color palette of lawn darts and Twister boards. It's retro. It's groovy. It's got more primary colors than a kindergarten art class.

### 💨 **Fart Clouds**
Yes. When you reveal the story, little fart cloud emojis float across your screen. YOU'RE WELCOME.

## 🚀 HOW TO PLAY

### Option 1: Just Host It Somewhere
Upload these three files anywhere:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`  
- `script.js`

GitHub Pages? ✅  
Netlify? ✅  
A Raspberry Pi in your closet? ✅  
Literally any web server? ✅  

### Option 2: Open It Locally
Double-click `index.html`. Boom. You're playing. (Note: Multiplayer needs HTTPS for WebRTC, so host it somewhere for that.)

---

## 🎭 THE MULTIPLAYER MAGIC

Here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. **Host creates a room** → Generates a unique room code
2. **Host becomes a PeerJS peer** → Free P2P signaling, no server needed
3. **Friends join with the code** → Direct connection established
4. **Everyone fills in silly words** → "Give me a NOUN" → "booger castle"
5. **Words get combined** → Round-robin from all players for maximum chaos
6. **Story revealed** → Laughter ensues. Milk exits noses. Memories made.

It uses **PeerJS** (free, open source) for signaling, then pure **WebRTC** for data. No messages go through any server. It's like passing notes in class, but through THE FABRIC OF THE INTERNET.

## 📱 MOBILE-FIRST, BABY

Big buttons. Big inputs. Big fonts. Works on phones, tablets, laptops, smart fridges (probably), and whatever else you've got lying around.

Touch-friendly. Thumb-friendly. Kid-friendly. Dad-joke-friendly.

## 🛠️ TECH STACK

| Tech | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Vanilla JS** | No build step. No npm. No node_modules black hole. Just vibes. |
| **PeerJS** | Free P2P signaling. It just works™ |
| **Google Fonts** | Fredoka & Comic Neue — fonts that scream "we're here to have FUN" |
| **CSS Variables** | Twister colors locked and loaded |
| **Pure HTML/CSS/JS** | Deploy anywhere. Forever. Until the heat death of the universe. |

## 🐛 BUGS?

Is it a bug or is it a *feature*? 

Just kidding. If something breaks, it's probably:
1. A network/firewall thing (WebRTC is picky)
2. Someone unplugged something
3. Mercury is in retrograde

## 💭 FINAL THOUGHTS

This game was built for one purpose: **making families laugh together**.

Whether you're across the dinner table or across the country, whether you're 7 or 70, whether you think "armpit" is the funniest word ever or you're more of a "belly button lint" person...

**This game is for you.**

Now go forth. Create rooms. Fill blanks. Reveal stories. Laugh until your faces hurt.

And remember: **the principal stood up and shouted "WHAT THE FART?!"**
